In this folder we are placing the GDML files being used in the MINER simulation.

At the top of each GDML file one needs to use: 

<gdml   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="/.../geant4_10_06_p02/source/persistency/gdml/schema/gdml.xsd">

in order to have local schema accessed, where /.../ is filled in with the path to your geant4 installation. The XML parser looks for the schema within 
a /gdml/schema/files.xsd pattern.

HybridShieldingHVShielding.gdml Has the Si hybrid and HV detectors along with their copper shielding.

MINERSetupAugust30.gdml is the MINER setup that contains the shielded detectors along with the original Pb brick configuration.
